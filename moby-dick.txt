                              CHAPTER 1. LOOMINGS.

cALL ME iSHMAEL. sOME YEARS AGO -NEVER MIND HOW LONG PRECISELY- HAVING
little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me
ON SHORE, i THOUGHT i WOULD SAIL ABOUT A LITTLE AND SEE THE WATERY PART
OF THE WORLD. iT IS A WAY i HAVE OF DRIVING OFF THE SPLEEN AND
regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about
THE MOUTH; WHENEVER IT IS A DAMP, DRIZZLY nOVEMBER IN MY SOUL; WHENEVER
i FIND MYSELF INVOLUNTARILY PAUSING BEFORE COFFIN WAREHOUSES, AND
bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever
my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral
principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and
methodically knocking peopleâ€™s hats off-then, I account it high time to
get to sea as soon as I can.
